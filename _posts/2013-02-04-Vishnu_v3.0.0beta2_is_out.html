<p>Here is the corresponding changelog:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New features:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added beta support for submitting jobs to a Cloud, using DeltaCloud
        (tested with OpenStack only). Currently, only the Vishnu user is
        used, there is no user switch during submission. The credentials
        need to be provided to VISHNU though an configuration file,
        options, or environment variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automtests have been updated: they do not launch the Vishnu platform,
        they use an already deployed one.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Bug fixes and improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The compilation process has been updated: you can now compile the
        client CLI and the servers separately
      </li>
      <li>
        Files necessary to build vishnu java library have been included in this
        repository. Currently there is no doc for this, see
        scripts/ALL_prepareScript.sh if you want the lib.
      </li>
      <li>
        fixed a bug where signal-interrupted zmq calls (EINTR) were not
        handled properly
      </li>
      <li>
        fixed a bug on the "POSIX" backend where the wallclock time was not
        correctly handled which caused submission scripts to sometimes be
        deleted before being executed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Warnings:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The database needs to be updated using scripts in
        core/database/database_update_addvminfo_*.sql
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
