	<h3>What is the WebBoard ? And what are application scripts?</h3>
	<p>The WebBoard is SysFera's generic application-centric web portal for 
	large computing infrastructures managed by <a href="/vishnu.html">Vishnu</a>.</p>
	<p>One of the main feature of the WebBoard is to allow users to use applications 
	without any knowledge about the platform, where the applications are, or how 
	to access them.</p>
	<p>To allow such a transparent and simple usage of applications, administrator 
	or project managers" (or any person having the correct rights) can create/update/remove
	applications from the WebBoard. Those applications are based on two things:<p>
	<ul>
	<li>A paradigm allowing the application manager to describe the input of the 
	application</li>
	<li>One script been fed with th input parameters and calling the application 
	(on the server it is located) the right way</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Finally when the user will use the automatically generated interface of the application 
	in the WebBoard (based on the various inputs declared at creation time), the 
	application will be called on the machines reserved for the end-user with the 
	provided inputs.</p>
