      <li>Unified configuration files: all Vishnu daemons and clients can have the same configuration file</li>
      <li>New documentation user/admin</li>
      <li>Add posix-shell: you can start TMS without batch scheduler, TMS functionalities available in the shell</li>

	directories have been removed.</li>
      <li>Java APIs are available</li>

	as input files.</li>
