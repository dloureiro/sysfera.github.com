	<h3>What is VISHNU?</h3>
	<p>VISHNU offers to end-users the capability of running computation tasks 
	(jobs) on remote servers through a simple interface that offers performance 
	and interoperability with different kind of batch scheduler softwares running
	 locally on the servers. VISHNU also offers files management services to 
	create, modify and transfer files on remote hosts using secure transfer 
	protocols. The VISHNU system is also capable of monitoring the performance 
	of the servers and to recover automatically from server failures.</p>
	<p>The VISHNU software consists of a client part that provides both command-line
	 executables and C++ shared libraries for integration into an application, and
	  a server part. Communications are handled by ZMQ. Other user interfaces are provided on top of the C++
	    API using SWIG wrappers: currently it is available as Python module and 
	    Java API.<p>
	<p>VISHNU is a modular system where each module can be deployed individually 
	on a server to provide a subset of all VISHNU services. For example the TMS 
	module can be deployed on one server for providing jobs handling services, 
	while other VISHNU services (user mgmt, files mgmt, etc.) are served from 
	another host. This allows a better performance by reducing the load on each 
	server.</p>
